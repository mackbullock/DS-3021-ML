Read through the case study and then discuss the problem as a group then address these questions below:

What problems are facing the organization? In pursuit of developing a recommender engine, the organization is having issues collecting data for it. One of these challenges is that the current dataset is small, which could lead to problems in the distribution later. Additionally, they're unsure of the system's eventual effectiveness since there are many factors they're looking to measure.

What is the target variable and what type (regression or classification) of solution are they developing? The target variable is finding the most successful mathematics software for the school. This solution would be a classification because we're measuring qualitative levels of success. 

How would they know the solution was working (business metric)? They would know the solution works if the recommendations are both accurate and assist the students and staff. Additionally, the solution should result in long-term cost savings.

What other issues might the team be facing? Another issue they could run into is possibly overgeneralizing the solution or the overrepresentation of certain districts. In other words, they need to make sure recommendations are equitable.   

Work through the following Data to Concept and Learning:

How difficult is the data to gather? The data is difficult to gather because they are looking to cover a range of variables such as school demographics and teacher preparedness that could easily be complicated with the smaller dataset.  

Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts? The target is difficult to measure since they want to recommender to solve so many things at once. Each district also has its own collection of nuances where opinions on educational priorities varies significantly.


What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept? I do not want to take too much risk when working on this solution because billions are already  wasted on unsuccessful software annually.
